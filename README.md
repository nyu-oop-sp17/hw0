# Homework 0

You will not be able to complete any assignments until I've added you to the Github organization for the class, which will give you access to the class repositories.

* Sign up for a Github account, if you do not have one already. If you do have one already, associate your nyu email address with that account [here](https://github.com/settings/emails).
* Complete [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/dGKYhFlRDMQOmSwu2), which also requires you to enter your Github username.
* In a few days you will get an email from Github with an invitation to join the nyu-oop-sp17 organization. Follow the instructions to accept the invitation.
    
Once you have accepted the invitation you will be able to see the other repositories here, including hw1.
